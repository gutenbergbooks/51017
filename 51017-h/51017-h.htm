great and learned Pig, of which it is our hap to
ſpeak, was produced in a ſty belonging to an old Tory,
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;6&#160;]</span>
bookſeller, in
<a id="fnanc2" href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">†</a>
<i>Moorfields</i>. At that time <i>Moorfields</i> was diſtinguiſhed
by rails which
<a id="fnanc3" href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">‡</a>
fluttered with party writings and
libels of every ſort; and it is remarkable that his mother,
during her pregnancy, tore down from thoſe rails, and fairly
devoured one whole volume of <i>Filmer</i> and all <i>Sacheverell</i>’s
ſermons at a meal; after which ſhe was obſerved to grunt
more and louder, and to lie longer in the ſun, and deeper in
the mire, than it had before been her cuſtom to do. She
was delivered of our Pig on the morning of the <i>tenth of
June</i>. He was ſtrong and bony, but of an inelegant form,
and betrayed a very uncommon roughneſs in his ſqueak; and
it was ſoon after remarked by the neighbours, that his
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;7&#160;]</span>
trottings after his mother were made in
<a id="fnanc4" href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">§</a>
zig-zags, and not in
ſtraight lines as is uſual with other pigs. After his mother,
however, he reſolutely trotted, and one morning, as ill fortune
would have it, into a garden which had belonged to the
great <i>Milton</i>, and was now in the poſſeſſion of one of his
daughters. Here he fed voraciouſly upon <i>white roſes</i>, whilſt
his lady mother was buſily employed in rooting up all the <i>red
ones</i>. He was in this place ſeized by the owner, and ſo ſeverely
whipped, that he thought no other than that ſhe was
whipping him to death in preparation for a luxurious meal.
Of this whipping he retained through life the higheſt reſentment,
and bore ever after the moſt inveterate hatred of the
whole <i>Miltonic line</i>. On the fifth of November following he
was taken up, without any warrant, by the rabble, for the
uſes of a <i>Whig feaſt</i>, and was very near being <i>roaſted</i> at the
ſame fire with the <i>Pope</i>, the <i>Devil</i>, and the <i>Pretender</i>;
but this <span class="xxpn">[&#160;8&#160;]</span>
being diſcovered to be ſomething <i>meaſly</i>, he was turned looſe
to be cured, as they deridingly ſaid, by the
<a id="fnanc5" href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">◊</a>
<i>royal touch</i>. Of
this event he retained the ſtrongeſt ſenſibility, and conſidered
ever after his fellow ſufferers, the <i>Pope</i> and the <i>Pretender</i>,
with great complacence, if not affection; but as to the other
<i>party</i>, though expoſed to the ſame diſhonours, there was ſomething
in his horns and his tail which he could never be brought
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;9&#160;]</span>
to endure. The touch already mentioned, though profanely
ſneered at by the <i>Whig rabble</i>, was ſoon afterwards in good
earneſt applied; but ſo great an obliquity of head had by
this time taken place, that it could never be perfectly reſtored.
Upon this memorable occaſion there was placed
about his neck a ribband of <i>true blue</i>, to which hung a ſilver
coin, diſplaying royal lineaments of the <i>Stuart line</i>, making
ſo ſtrong an impreſſion on his young fancy, that for that line
he ever after retained the moſt
<a id="fnanc6" href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">#</a>
paſſionate regard. Thus
decorated, he conſidered himſelf, and was conſidered by
others, as a kind of
<a id="fnanc7" href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">♦</a>
<i>Tantony</i>, or <i>St. Anthony</i>’s Pig, belonging
to the Crown. Not long after this period he was
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;10&#160;]</span>
heard one morning as he lay in the ſun to grunt forth, portentouſly
the following rhymes:</p>

<div class="poembox fsize6"><div class="stanza">
<div class="pverse">Gruntledum, gruntledum, gruntledum, ſqueak,</div>
<div class="pverse">I hope very ſoon to be able to ſpeak;</div>
<div class="pverse">Through my griſtly proboſcis, I find, that I can</div>
<div class="pverse">Already cry <i>Ay</i> like a Parliament man:</div>
<div class="pverse">Like a maid I ſqueak, like a lover can whine,</div>
<div class="pverse">And ſnort like an Alderman laden with wine.</div>
<div class="pverse">Gruntledum, gruntledum, gruntledum, ſqueak,</div>
<div class="pverse">I hope very ſoon to be able to ſpeak.</div>
</div></div>

“He was not at all offended, when, comparing all our
acquaintance to ſome animal or other, we pitched upon the elephant for
his reſemblance, adding, that the proboſcis of that creature was like
his mind moſt exactly, ſtrong to buffet even the tyger, and pliable to
pick up even the pin.”—Piozzi, p. 205.—N.B. For elephant our author
probably read <i>pig</i>.</p></li>

“When in company where he was not free, or when engaged earneſtly in
converſation, he never gave way to ſuch habits, which proves that they were not
involuntary.” I ſtill, however, think, that theſe geſtures were involuntary; for
ſurely had not that been the caſe, he would have reſtrained them in the public
ſtreets.—Boſwell’s Tour, p. 9.</p></li>

<p class="hang2"><a id="fn5" href="#fnanc5" class="fnlabel">◊</a>
The pretence of a miraculous power in the cure of the evil was the moſt
extraordinary ſtrain of that King-craft of which James the Firſt ſo loudly boaſted.
No manly man, under the circumſtances of the caſe, would have ſet up this
pretence, or have expected any effect from it but that of public deriſion and
contempt; but weak and credulous men take, perhaps, the beſt meaſure of
human weakneſs and credulity, and ſo deep did this fraud ſtrike its roots, that,
authenticated as it was by the clergy, and annually certified by the ſurgeons and
phyſicians of the royal houſehold, it ſurvived the civil war, was reſtored
with Charles the Second, extended beyond the revolution, and was only extinguiſhed
by the act of ſettlement, which, taking the principles of the Britiſh
government out of the clouds, placed them on the firm baſis of the earth.
The pretenſions of Alexander were of a bolder and more rational ſort, and held
to be ſo important, that his ſucceſſors, who had no kindred intereſt in the horns
of Ammon, yet mingled them in their crowns and tiaras, till at laſt the Roman
Titans tumbled from their ſeats one after another theſe fictitious gods. The
moſt deceitful glimmer of divine claim ſeems to have had more influence on
the mind of the perſon who ſeems to have been deſignated in the text, than
the moſt ſolid principles of political right.</p></li>

Tantony pigs were pigs who belonged formerly to the Convent of St. Anthony
in the city. Collars were placed about their necks, inſcribed <i>St. Anthony</i>.
They fed all over the town, and out of reſpect to the fathers of that
convent, it was uſual for the paſſengers to give them biſcuits, and other things
carried for that purpoſe in their pockets. The pigs of courſe followed the
paſſengers in this expectation; and hence came the expreſſion of one perſon’s
following another like a Tantony pig.</p></li>

<p class="continue">This being publicly known, the neighbours now put on him
a human coat, in which condition he appeared as if the <i>Hog
in armour</i> had deſcended from his ſign-poſt to mingle in ſociety,
and converſe with man. Nor did they ſtop here, but
ventured alſo to recommend him for a penſion to the great
<i>miniſterial hog</i>, though, for the preſent, however, without
effect; for though it was evident enough that our learned
Pig could ſay <i>Ay</i>, yet it did not follow that he would be
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;11&#160;]</span>
always diſpoſed to do ſo. He was therefore turned looſe into
the ſoil of this great town to ſubſiſt as he could, where, <i>idling</i>
and <i>rambling</i>, he picked up ſometimes flowers, and ſometimes
thiſtles, a great number of Greek and Hebrew roots, with
an immenſe quantity of verbage of every ſort
<a id="fnanc8" href="#fn8" class="fnanchor">*</a>. It is for his
honour that he routed in this rich compoſt for years without
giving any offence, except that, through reſentment to the
Miltonic line, he aſſociated rather too long with a very obſcene
animal of the pig kind, called a
<a id="fnanc9" href="#fn9" class="fnanchor">†</a>
<i>Lauder</i>; and except, <span class="xxpn">[&#160;12&#160;]</span>
that he was taken ſometimes with ſtrange freaks, and fancied
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;13&#160;]</span>
once that he ſaw ſomething in the
<a id="fnanc10" href="#fn10" class="fnanchor">‡</a>
ſhape of a ſound of a
knocking; and excepting alſo his too ſonorous gruntulations,
and that long concatenation of ſoapy bubbles which
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;14&#160;]</span>
uſually frothed from his mouth
<a id="fnanc11" href="#fn11" class="fnanchor">§</a>. In the midſt of theſe
reſearches he had one morning the good fortune to throw up
this ſentiment in rhyme:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="stanza">

<div class="pverse">Who thinks kicking ſhould paſs through every degree;</div>

The perſon here deſigned is allowed by the courteſy of
the times to poſſeſs a nervous and elegant ſtile; but ſo unhappy is
the writer of this note, that he can by no means concur in the general
praiſe. He has a notion of Saxon ſimplicity, from which all departure,
not enforced by neceſſity, and regulated by taſte, aſſimilating, as
much as may be, foreign words to the genius of the Saxon tongue, is to
him intolerable. But the writer here ſpoken of was wholly deficient
in taſte, and appears to refer his Engliſh to ſome foreign ſtandard
chanting forth polyſyllables, and tiring the ear with dull returns of
the ſame cadences, for ever advancing like a poſt horſe, two up and two
down, and incapable of changing his pace, without throwing both himſelf
and his rider in the dirt. But hack writers, like hack horſes, find it
for their eaſe to practiſe an uniform rate.</p></li>

<i>There is</i>, ſays a remarker on the life of Milton, <i>a high degree of prepollent
probability that the letter in the Gentleman’s Magazine for the month of Auguſt 1747,
page 363 and 364, ſigned William Lauder, came from the amicable hand of the
writer of that life</i>. I do not, however, believe that the writer of Milton’s life
was in the ſecret of Lauder’s forgeries, the fact itſelf being of ſo extraordinary
a nature, that it is not probable that any two perſons, ſeparately capable of committing
it, ſhould ſo fortuitouſly meet together; yet ſuch was his malevolence towards
Milton, that we muſt admit it to have greatly clouded his underſtanding.
He undoubtedly wrote the preface and the poſtſcript to Lauder’s publication: in
alluſion to which, Doctor Douglas ſays, <i>that ’tis hoped, nay ’tis expected, that the
the elegant and nervous writer, whoſe judicious ſentiments and inimitable ſtyle point out
author of Lauder’s preface and poſtſcript, will no longer allow one to plume himſelf
with his feathers, who appears ſo little to have deſerved his aſſiſtance</i>. Lauder confeſſes
his guilt in a letter to Doctor Douglas, and takes all the obloquy on himſelf;
but in a ſubſequent letter he declares, that the penitential one was written for
him by that very gentleman, who has ſince written the life of Milton, and makes
ſome complaints of a breach of friendſhip, <i>in which he had placed the moſt implicit
and unlimited confidence</i>; but as he never charged, that I know of, the writer of
Milton’s life with any participation in the forgery, we impute to him nothing
but a ſtrange malignity which darkened his underſtanding. It muſt be owned,
however, that he cut off the wreck of Lauder with great management, as well
as competent ſucceſs. I remember that he boaſts in his life of Milton of his
having written a prologue to the Comus of Milton, for the benefit of one of
his grand daughters. This, I ſuppoſe, he would paſs for his benevolence; but
he muſt excuſe me; I am not ſo much the dupe of charity as to believe, that
he who ſo brutally calumniates Milton, his father, mother, uncles, wives, and
children, <i>and all unfortunate ſouls that trace him in his line</i>, would be moved by
any charitable diſpoſition towards any deſcendant of Milton’s, as being ſuch.
The fact, I believe, is, that, finding Milton reduced by the labours of his friend
Lauder to a level with his wiſhes, he practiſed, in concurrence with Mr. Lauder,
one further act of malice, and endeavoured to fix an obligation on Milton in the
perſon of his granddaughter, conferred by his moſt inveterate foes as the effect
of ſatiated vengeance, converted into mingled pity and contempt. If there is
any harſhneſs in this note, let it be remembered, that it ſpeaks of a man who,
in the inſtance mentioned, let looſe the moſt outrageous malignity againſt one,
who, whatever political errors he might have imbibed in common with a great
majority of the nation, was, however, as a private man, of ſo exemplary a virtue,
as to do the higheſt honour to literary purſuit, and whoſe genius, as a poet, conferred
celebrity on the nation itſelf, and in whoſe protection therefore we ought
to have taken a greater ſhare.</p></li>

The hiſtory of this knocking is curious; it forms ſuch a drama of comedy,
tragedy, and farce, from its firſt commencement in Cock Lane, paſſing through
the ſolemn vaults of Clerkenwell, and then to Weſtminſter Hall, as, I believe,
never was exhibited in any other country; a drama wherein childiſhneſs and
age, gravity, dignities, folly, fraud, ſuperſtition, and credulity, were all largely
and confuſedly thrown in to thicken the plot. That the perſon here deſignated
ſhould carry out of this ſcene any reſpectability of character, is a proof that
either he muſt have poſſeſſed great intrinſic worth, who could bear ſuch large
deductions, or that public opinion has ceaſed to be the teſt of merit, if any
baſe metal can in this manner paſs current for gold.</p></li>

Our biographer ſhould have told us alſo, that once he joined the train of
fancy, and paſſing the limits of fact, entered by the Shakeſpearean gate into
fairy land. But in an evil hour, “No favouring Sybil marked the devious
way.” Never was man or pig ſo aſtounded! and no wonder. He had ſtumbled
unaccountably on the creations of ſenſibility, and found no correſponding
emotions within; yet, unconſcious of defect, he pretended a knowledge of
the country, and even offered himſelf as an unerring guide; but not long; for,
tired with the maze, he gave way, at length, to new adventurers, and fled as
another Gulliver out of Lilliput, where he had only encumbered the
land.</p></li>

“No man, however, was more jealouſly attached to his

<p class="continue">There needed no more;
a penſion was immediately hung
about his neck, and the letters L.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D. ſoon afterwards impreſſed
on his rump
<a id="fnanc13" href="#fn13" class="fnanchor">*</a>.
And now who but our Pig? lying in the
ſun, cheek by jowl, by the great miniſterial Hog, routing in the
political ſoil, and throwing up daily the moſt delicious
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;16&#160;]</span> pig-nuts
with his ſnout; nor did theſe diſcoveries reſt wholly in
himſelf; for the great Hog would ſometimes let fall, from behind,
certain rich, but often crude and ill-digeſted, materials,
which were taken up in the Weſtphalian mode by our Pig, and
delivered again better concocted to the many-headed beaſt:
and hence we were taught, that Taxation was no Tyranny, and
that a good American war was a very commodious and ſalutary
thing. Great applauſe enſued, but not unattended with
envy, there being at the time many ſnarlers who have ſaid,
and now ſay, that it were better if our Pig had been, before
this period, well ſouſed in the pickling tub, and that even the
great miniſterial Hog himſelf had been hung up for bacon.
I decide nothing on theſe brawls; yet, having reſpect to a
certain ſuppoſed dignity in our Pig, it may, perhaps, excite
ſome wonder, that he, whoſe politics were of no older a date
than his penſion, and who had hitherto never routed out of the
moral track, ſhould all at once lend himſelf out in this manner,
and make his conſcience reſponſible for meaſures, of the
principles or effects of which he muſt have been ſo incompetent
a judge. But I anſwer in few words, that, like all other
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;17&#160;]</span>
politicians, he had his propenſities; that it was, perhaps, the
nature of the animal, and that mingling his humours and his
reaſon together, there might have been a competent ſincerity
in the caſe. But what ſhall we ſay to the indecency of his
turning up the graves of <i>Pope</i> and
<a id="fnanc14" href="#fn14" class="fnanchor">†</a>
<i>Swift</i>, (for I ſpeak not
now of Milton) and goring them, Tories as they were, with
ſo malicious a tooth? I anſwer, firſt, that they were not
Tories. <i>Pope</i> placed his glory in moderation; and <i>Swift</i>
was the renegade of one party, without being the convert of
the other. But it was not <i>Whig</i> or <i>Tory</i>, I believe, which
now moved our Pig: there are other inſtinctive enmities in
the world. Theſe men of real genius were ſatiriſts by profeſſion,
and the natural enemies of Pigſ—“<i>The fewer ſtill I
name</i>,” ſays Pope, “<i>I hurt the more</i>.”—“<i>Bond is but one, but
Balaam is a ſcore</i>;” and again, “An hundred ſmart in
<i>Timon and in Balaam</i>.” And I believe that our Pig ſmarted
in <i>Bentley</i>, <i>Tibbald</i>, and poſſibly in many others; the ſtorm
<span class="xxpn" id="p18">[&#160;18&#160;]</span>
had but juſt patted before him, and he heard the arrowy
ſhower ſtill rattle in his ear, and was conſcious, perhaps, that
had he come forth a day ſooner, he would have been placed
in a diſtinguiſhed, but, to him, a very unpleaſant, niche in
the Dunciad of <i>Pope</i>,</p>

<p>Where he inſults therefore the mighty dead, his rage is at
leaſt natural; and when, to wound <i>Pope</i>, he ſuborns the
tongue of a
<a id="fnanc15" href="#fn15" class="fnanchor">*</a>
kitchen wench, he preſerves, however, a nice
proportion between his end and his means, doing, with very
ſingular propriety, the baſeſt thing in, what muſt be allowed
to be, the loweſt way. But we abſtain, we affect not gravity,
we even forget his almoſt felonious attack upon Milton,
and proceed. We have already noted the facility with which
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;19&#160;]</span>
our learned Pig could ſay <i>Ay</i>. It was a great accompliſhment;
but he had alſo his defects.
<a id="fnanc16" href="#fn16" class="fnanchor">†</a>
No art, no inſtruction
could ever bring him to make a tolerable bow, or indeed to
practice any civil grimace whatever; and his higheſt approach,
in this way, towards humanity, never went farther
than to entitle him, from the moſt exquiſite judge, to the
character of a very <i>reſpectable Hottentot</i>: and hence he became
at laſt to be conſidered as a very great
<a id="fnanc17" href="#fn17" class="fnanchor">‡</a>
<i>Bore</i>; under
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;20&#160;]</span>
which diſgrace he retired to a brewery in the Borough.—Happy
retirement! for here he was fed with the freſheſt grains
by the fair hand of a lady, who condeſcended to become the
prieſteſs of our Pig; a lady who had acquired the Greek language
without loſing her own, and whoſe manners and latinity
were both equally pure. How great therefore muſt have
been his grief, when he afterwards ſaw his fair provider melt
away into the arms of a ſoft, but doubtleſs ſinewy Signor,
and bathe herſelf, as it is yet her fortune to do, in the voluptuous
warmths of Italy. But her’s, however be the praiſe,
that, compoſed of gentle paſſions, ſhe conſcientiouſly ſacrificed,
at thirty-eight, fortune, freedom, and England, only to
legalize her delights. Never in any future period may ſhe
be repentant of her choice, but always find in the joys of
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;21&#160;]</span>
harmony a compenſation for the decays of love. From the
fair hand of this lady our Pig was not only fed with the fineſt
grains, but with the choiceſt green peas alſo, the earlieſt of
the year—delicious food, as he himſelf confeſſes—for a
<a id="fnanc18" href="#fn18" class="fnanchor">§</a>
<i>Pig</i>.
By her too was prepared for him the moſt inviting draff,
which he ſwilled up at all hours with huge avidity and delight.
But the lady had her humours; ſhe grew tired of one
thing, and fond of another; ſhe ſought, upon preſſing inducements,
the great rendezvous of Bath; and ſo the joys of
the brewery had an end. Many were of opinion, (for who
can pleaſe all,) that a certain diſtillery in the neighbourhood
would have been a more apt and proper retreat for our Pig;—but
there were difficulties; I enter not into domeſtic affairs;
but whether there was any whiggiſm, or rivalſhip, or
jealouſy, or what elſe in the caſe, I know not; but certain it
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;22&#160;]</span>
is, that Sir Joſeph and he could never, as they ought, well pig
together. During the happy period above mentioned, it came
into the fancy of our Pig to journey into Scotland in the character
of a travelling bear, with a ragged ſtaff in his paws,
and a
<a id="fnanc19" href="#fn19" class="fnanchor">◊</a>
monkey on his back. When he firſt obtained a penſion,
he had been very affectionately conſidered by the people
of that country, and in a manner naturalized, and become one
of them; but he diſcovered ſoon afterwards, and more particularly
on this occaſion, ſo much of the badger in his diſpoſition,
that they found great reaſon to complain of the ſtrength
and harſhneſs of his jaw. On his return he reſorted again to
his beloved brewery, as yet profuſe of grains and draff,
where he grunted forth, as was his cuſtom, many ſtrange and
ſingular things, faithfully now on record, pretending alſo to
cure certain mental diſeaſes by the medicinal qualities of his
tongue; but its extreme roughneſs the ſenſibility of his patients
could not bear. Enough has been ſaid; the reſt ſhall
<span class="xxpn">[&#160;23&#160;]</span>
be left to Bozzy. Yet we will add, that with all his peculiarities,
he had virtues and merits enough to make us heartily
wiſh he were ſtill in being:—But, alas, it is paſt, and he is
now cutting up into junks, to be ſold <i>pro bono publico</i> at nine
different ſhops in retail.</p>

Moſt of what can be told concerning his petty
peculiarities was communicated by a female domeſtic of the Earl of

And yet certain it is that no pains was ſpared for this purpoſe; for “my
mother (ſaid he) was always telling me that I did not behave myſelf; that I
ſhould endeavour to learn behaviour, and ſuch cant.” Indeed his defect in this
particular could not be overlooked by his moſt partial admirer; for “I ſuppoſe
none (ſays ſhe) who ſaw his odd manner of geſticulation, much blamed or wondered
at the good lady’s ſolicitude concerning her ſon’s behaviour.”—Piozzi’s
Memoirs of Johnſon, p. 24 and 25.</p></li>

Cant words are uſually begot in a cellar by <i>fun</i> upon <i>folly</i>: but the word
<i>bore</i> and <i>boar</i> has another origin; it was begot on a ſofa by <i>Madamoiſelle Ennui</i>
upon herſelf, and brought forth into the world in the midſt of the ton. The
roar and fury of the river Severn the people of the country call the <i>boar</i>. A
female ſaint was reported miraculouſly to have ſhed tears: the fact was denied
by a Madrid carpenter who had made the ſaint, “becauſe (ſays he) ſhe is not
only compoſed of heart of oak, but if ſhe had been at all diſpoſed to weep, ſhe
muſt have wept when I <i>bored</i> an aperture with my largeſt augre in her rump.”
And thus teazing and vexation of every kind may be called a <i>bore</i>. A dun is a
<i>bore</i>, and a ſermon is a <i>bore</i>, and ſo forth; but the greateſt of all poſſible <i>bores</i>,
in whatever ſpelling, is a huſband, a <i>bore</i> at night, a <i>bore</i> in the morning, and,
in ſhort, one general univerſal <i>bore</i>. Our author has uſed this faſhionable word
with the moſt perfect propriety, in a ſenſe ſatisfying the very letter, as well as
ſpirit of the word.</p></li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
